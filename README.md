# euler_cpp

Learning to code in C++ by sequentially solving problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Solving the fist 100+ problems was a great way for me to learn C years ago, so maybe it will help out with C++ as well.

For this project, I will try to avoid exploiting the fact that C++ is (for the most part) a superset of C. Instead of just writing C code, making minimal updates, and then compiling it with g++, I'll actually be trying my best to explicitly use the "new" C++ features and more of a C++ coding style.

Along the way, I anticipate I'll also learn a little more about Makefiles and using Git/GitHub.
